1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,679
In the previous
section, we talked about Git,

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,439
that Git is the most popular open
version control system that tracks changes

3
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:19,199
within the same file and also allow
us to collaborate with our peers.

4
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:25,239
Now, throughout the course, you will
notice that git with small g getting used,

5
00:00:25,239 --> 00:00:29,300
and also the git with capital G
is getting used interchangeably.

6
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,479
We use Git with capital G for the project,

7
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:37,060
whereas the Git with
small g refers to the actual

8
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,920
software and is used in all the commands.

9
00:00:43,659 --> 00:00:46,960
Now we know what is Git,
let's also talk about GitHub.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,719
You know that you can use
Git completely free on your

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,539
local computer to track
the changes in your files.

12
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,320
So it's just a software which you
can download and get started with it.

13
00:00:59,189 --> 00:01:04,090
However, if you want your project
to be hosted over the internet,

14
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:08,590
you need a hosting service like
GitHub or GitLab or Bitbucket.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,790
All the companies use their own
hosting platforms. Some of them use GitLab,

16
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,500
some of them use Bitbucket.

17
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,549
They are the most popular ones.

18
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:22,230
So GitHub is owned by Microsoft.

19
00:01:22,609 --> 00:01:26,510
It's a hosting provider
that provides platform for

20
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,930
developers to store their
Git repositories online,

21
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:34,319
collaborate with others, and
also manage the code contributions.

22
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:38,810
A project hosted on
GitHub acts as the main

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:41,349
source for everyone
working on that project,

24
00:01:41,349 --> 00:01:44,980
which means that everyone
who is working on that project

25
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,879
would read and write
into the same project.

26
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:53,629
Also, GitHub provides graphical
user interface for many Git features,

27
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:59,299
like merging issues or viewing commits,
and there are many more such features.

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,959
A lot of people confuse
between Git and GitHub,

29
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,840
but both are totally separate things.

30
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,050
Git is not the same thing as GitHub.

31
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:11,759
Git is basically an open
source version control software,

32
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:16,550
which you can download it in your
computer and start tracking your files.

33
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:21,419
So GitHub is a hosting platform for
the files which are managed by Git.

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,610
Basically, you have your
project on your local.

35
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,419
If you want to host it on the internet,

36
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:29,919
then you can leverage
GitHub as a hosting platform.
