00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:11,039
To recap what we learned in this
lesson, so first we talked about stash,

2
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,880
and we learned how to
stash and unstash commits.

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:18,089
Then we also saw different
ways to squash our commits.

4
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,030
Squashing is basically
combining multiple commits into one.

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,609
Then we talked about interactive rebase,

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:28,839
and we saw the powers
of interactive rebase,

7
00:00:28,839 --> 00:00:33,689
that we can use interactive rebase for
amending, squashing, and deleting commits.

8
00:00:34,609 --> 00:00:36,590
Finally, we talked about git reflog,

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,890
and we saw how we can recover our
deleted commits and deleted branches.

10
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:43,590
Now moving to the exercise part.

11
00:00:45,439 --> 00:00:49,259
As an exercise for part
one, create a feature branch.

12
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,060
You can call it anything
or feature git advanced.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,659
Make three commits to the branch.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,780
Change the commit message
of the second last commit.

15
00:01:00,939 --> 00:01:04,329
Also, squash the last two
commits and verify using

16
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:06,969
git log if everything
is changed correctly.

17
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:13,489
As a part two, make a commit,
delete the commit using hard reset,

18
00:01:13,489 --> 00:01:16,579
and then try to
recover the deleted commit.
