Welcome to Lesson 7,
Learning Git Advanced.

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,369
In this lesson, we'll tackle some
advanced Git features that will enhance

3
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:18,050
your workflow and give you more
control over your project history.

4
00:00:18,969 --> 00:00:22,239
These tools are particularly
useful when managing complex

5
00:00:22,239 --> 00:00:25,510
changes or cleaning up
your Git commit history.

6
00:00:26,379 --> 00:00:31,449
We'll start by learning how to use
git stash to temporarily save changes,

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,179
followed by exploring
how to squash multiple

8
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,289
commits into one to
keep your history clean.

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,840
After that, we'll dive
into interactive rebase.

10
00:00:41,619 --> 00:00:44,079
And finally, we
explore git reflog command,

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,649
which lets you track changes in your
git history and recover from mistakes.

12
00:00:49,509 --> 00:00:52,000
Then we wrap up with a
summary of everything

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,939
we have learned, followed by an exercise.

14
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:59,009
That's the roadmap for this lesson. Let's
dive into these advanced git techniques.
