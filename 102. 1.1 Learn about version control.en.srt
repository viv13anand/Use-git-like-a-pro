00:00:06,669 --> 00:00:09,660
Before we jump into the
world of Git and GitHub,

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,449
let's first talk about version control.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,169
What is a version control?

4
00:00:14,029 --> 00:00:16,960
So basically, whenever you're
working with digital files,

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:22,079
whether it's a doc file or any
programming file like Python or JS file,

6
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,379
you probably won't
finish all the work at once.

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:30,420
In that case, the software
you use to manage and track

8
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,420
changes in those files
is your version control.

9
00:00:34,299 --> 00:00:36,520
To understand it better,
let's take an example.

10
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,700
Let's say I want to
create this git course.

11
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:45,250
So I started with a git course.doc
file and added my content there.

12
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:50,210
Next day, I wanted to make
some more changes to it,

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,509
so I copied this file and created
git course underscore v1.doc file.

14
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:00,590
During my final revision, I created
another copy, which is the final doc,

15
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,899
and added my final modifications there.

16
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:08,680
Now, why I was creating all those
files, why I was copying all those files,

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:12,400
and it is just to make
sure that I could go back

18
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,189
to the previous
version in case I need them.

19
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:22,500
Now, this approach technically works.
I'm able to track the changes in my files,

20
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,400
go back to the previous versions.

21
00:01:25,099 --> 00:01:28,840
But let's say you're working on a
project with hundreds of files.

22
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:34,370
In that case, creating multiple files
for each of the file in the project,

23
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,739
it's not really scalable.

24
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,590
Although this idea makes sense,

25
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,079
but creating multiple files at work
can get really messy really fast.

26
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,120
Alternatively, what you
could have done is that you

27
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,260
can try to update the same
file over and over again,

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,689
but what if you want to go
back to the previous version

29
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,269
because there is some
bug in the new version?

30
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,189
Also, what if you want to work with
others, with your coworkers on the same file?

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,340
So we want a system which is robust
that allow us to work on the same file,

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,129
but also retain the
history of previous versions.

33
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,569
A version control
system is such system which

34
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:19,949
allow us to track changes within the same

35
00:02:19,949 --> 00:02:25,449
file without creating multiple files and
also collaborate with others and much more.

36
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,509
A version control system
should also be distributed

37
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:32,639
in order to avoid any
single point of failure.

38
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:38,949
Git is one of the most popular
version control systems that we have.

39
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:43,349
It allows us to track
changes within the same file and

40
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,939
also allows us to
collaborate with our coworkers.

41
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,319
It's free and open source and
downloadable to your own local computer.
