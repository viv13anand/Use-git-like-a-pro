1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:11,189
We have covered a lot of ground in this
course, and now that we are wrapping up,

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:13,560
you should feel
confident using Git like a pro.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,250
From basics to advanced features,

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:19,570
you have learned how to
effectively manage your projects

5
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:22,890
using one of the most
popular version control system.

6
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,600
Let's take a moment to recap all
the key topics we have explored.

7
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,940
In the first lesson, we
started with an overview of version

8
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,369
control and got
familiar with Git and GitHub.

9
00:00:35,149 --> 00:00:37,750
We set up Git, learned key terminologies,

10
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,840
and understood the basics of
pushing code to a remote repository.

11
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:48,750
In the second lesson, we focused on
how to use Git in your daily workflow,

12
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,820
including adding and committing
files, fetching, pulling changes,

13
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,049
and working from both the command
line and graphical user interface.

14
00:00:57,229 --> 00:01:00,189
We then moved on to mastering
commits in the third lesson.

15
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:05,400
Here we learned how to create
well-structured commits, amend commits,

16
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,290
write meaningful commit messages, and
compare changes using git diff command.

17
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,250
In the fourth lesson, we took a
deeper look at undoing changes,

18
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,060
covering essential commands like
git checkout, git restore, git reset,

19
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:25,400
and git revert to help you roll
back or adjust your work as needed.

20
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,640
The fifth lesson
introduced us to branches and tags,

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,180
where we explored how to create and
manage branches, delete and rename them,

22
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,310
and implement effective
branching strategies.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:42,510
We also learned how to tag specific points

24
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,959
in the repository,
especially for releases.

25
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:49,769
In the sixth lesson, we
tackled merging and rebasing,

26
00:01:49,769 --> 00:01:53,439
understanding the theory behind
each, practicing both the techniques,

27
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,879
and learning how to handle conflicts.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,159
We also touched on creating
pull requests for collaboration.

29
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,370
Finally, in the seventh lesson,

30
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:09,349
we explored some Git advanced features
like Git stash for saving work in progress,

31
00:02:09,349 --> 00:02:13,620
squashing commits to clean up commit
history, using interactive rebase,

32
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,180
and tracking changes with Git reflog.

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,319
And that's the course. Thank you for
joining me in this journey to master Git.

34
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,919
I hope now you feel equipped to
use Git confidently in your project.
