1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:11,740
In the previous section, we learned how
to create a repository on our computer,

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,769
but that repository right now
exists only on our local machine.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,199
Now, what we want is
to have that repository

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,879
on the remote server,
which is on the GitHub.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,940
In order to do that, we
need to start with the GitHub.

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,039
We need to create a new
repository on the GitHub.

7
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:33,899
The second step is that once
you have created the repository,

8
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,329
it will give you a URL
for the remote repository.

9
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,240
Next, you need to tell Git
that what is the remote URL.

10
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,359
So you need to add the
remote using command git remote,

11
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,729
add the name of the remote
and the URL which you have

12
00:00:51,729 --> 00:00:54,270
been provided when you
created the repository.

13
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,299
Once you add the remote, the third step
is to push your branch to the remote,

14
00:01:01,299 --> 00:01:05,739
and that's it. You will have your
project hosted on the remote server.

15
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,780
Let's see how this looks in practice.

16
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,310
Let's go back to our
project, which is Git course.

17
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,329
So now I want to, this is my project.

18
00:01:25,969 --> 00:01:31,030
It has file one and gitignore
and a bunch of more folders.

19
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,950
Now I want to push
this to my remote server.

20
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,200
In order to do that, first I
will go to github.com and here

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,890
you can click on repositories
and on the right hand side,

22
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:48,030
click on new, new repository.

23
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:55,120
There's also a shortcut that you can use
if you want to create a new repository.

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:58,069
You can simply do depot.new,

25
00:01:58,069 --> 00:02:03,120
and you will be landed to
this Create New Repository page.

26
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:12,389
So now let's call it GetVideoCourse.

27
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,969
Add description. This
is a Git video course.

28
00:02:21,789 --> 00:02:26,030
Now there are two options here. One is
the public and another one is private.

29
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:30,960
The public repositories are the
repositories which are visible to everyone.

30
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,349
So basically anybody can
view this repository and they

31
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:38,080
can go to your GitHub
profile and see what you have.

32
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:43,889
If you want to make it private, you
can go with the private. In that case,

33
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:46,189
only you will have
access to the repository

34
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:48,770
and nobody else would be able to view it.

35
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:53,400
For now, I'm good with the public
ones, so I'll just keep it as public.

36
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,599
There is also an option
to add a README file.

37
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,610
I will just leave it for now.

38
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,150
Gitignore, there's also
a template which you can

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:04,650
choose from here in
the Gitignore template,

40
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,629
but we have already added a
Gitignore file, so I will not choose any,

41
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:12,830
but you can basically
select any template as well,

42
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,680
and it will generate a template for you,

43
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,590
similar to the one which we
saw in the previous section.

44
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,860
Now just hit create repository.

45
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,979
So now what we want to do is that we
already have a repository on our local machine.

46
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,310
So we are in this, in this case,

47
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:42,039
like we have a repository
on our local and we want to

48
00:03:42,039 --> 00:03:45,189
push the existing
repository to the GitHub server.

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:52,840
So first we need to, we have created the
repository. Now we want to add remote,

50
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,319
so I will just copy this command.

51
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,659
So this is my, this is the
URL of my remote server.

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,620
This is where my repository
will exist on the remote server.

53
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:12,909
So I will just copy this command, and
here I will simply type git remote add,

54
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:20,029
This is the name, this is an alias,
because for the URL, it is a quite long URL,

55
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,819
so I will tell Git to
use origin as the name

56
00:04:23,819 --> 00:04:27,269
whenever I want to read
and write to the URL.

57
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:33,629
You can basically name it anything, you
can also name it as whatever you want,

58
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,560
your own name, or just a random name,

59
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,160
but make sure that you will have to use
it again, and mostly in Git, we use origin.

60
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:47,379
So once we have added the remote,

61
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:53,759
now you can verify if the remote has
been added with command git remote minus v,

62
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,740
and it says that, okay,
your remote name is origin,

63
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,720
which you can use for pushing to the
repo and also reading from the repo.

64
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,319
Now if I want to push it,
so this is a push command.

65
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,649
It is used to push your
changes to the remote server.

66
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:16,689
Let's run git push.

67
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:22,889
Okay, now we are getting the
error, fail to push some revs to this.

68
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,540
Let's verify if our
remote is set correctly.

69
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,500
I think it is.

70
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,740
Okay, we have it set.

71
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:40,110
So why we are getting this error is
basically because we don't have any commits.

72
00:05:40,629 --> 00:05:49,769
So right now, if I do grid
status, I have not made any commit,

73
00:05:49,769 --> 00:05:53,240
so if you are trying to
push an empty commit,

74
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,019
it's possible that you
will get this error,

75
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:58,810
fail to push some riffs
because nothing exists.

76
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,970
So what I'm going to do is
that we can make a commit.

77
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:05,709
Don't worry about the syntax.

78
00:06:06,889 --> 00:06:11,370
Get into these commands in detail
as we progress through the code.

79
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:20,100
So I need to first add the files and
make a commit using a git commit command.

80
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,139
So now I have made a
commit, and now if I do git push,

81
00:06:31,579 --> 00:06:35,389
You can see the local repository is pushed

82
00:06:35,389 --> 00:06:38,730
to this remote repository that we created.

83
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:45,230
So we can go and check in our GitHub
that if we have the files already.

84
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:50,040
I will just refresh this one,

85
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,170
and you can see we have
gitignore and file1.txt already.

86
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,389
Now, in our local, we had more files.

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,189
So you see in this local repo, we
also have coverage and node modules,

88
00:07:07,189 --> 00:07:10,420
but we did not see it in our remote.

89
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,240
And that is because we added
these files in the gitignore.

90
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:20,550
So if you have a specified git that
these are the files I don't want to track,

91
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:25,629
I don't want it to be a part of
git, then when you are pushing,

92
00:07:25,629 --> 00:07:28,689
git doesn't care about
pushing these folders and files.

93
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,040
So now you know how to push your local
repository to your remote repository.

94
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,750
The next thing I also want to talk
about is the remote name. For now,

95
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:45,759
what we have done is that we have
kept the remote name as origin.

96
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,829
You must have noticed when
I do git remote minus v,

97
00:07:50,829 --> 00:07:57,329
it shows origin with the remote URL, but
you can also rename it to anything else,

98
00:07:57,329 --> 00:08:02,620
and for that, you can use git
remote rename, the old remote name,

99
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:05,060
and then your new remote name.

100
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,579
Let's try it out.

101
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:12,339
Now, if I want to check the remote
name, I can do git remote minus v.

102
00:08:12,339 --> 00:08:16,230
And right now, it is origin,
and this is the remote repo URL,

103
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,029
and we are calling it origin.

104
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,360
Now, just to remind you
that origin is just an alias.

105
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,060
You can name it anything.

106
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,759
So we'll do git remote.

107
00:08:27,329 --> 00:08:27,769
Rename.

108
00:08:28,629 --> 00:08:33,950
Instead of origin, I want
to use, let's say, base.

109
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:39,730
So first we need to type the origin,
the old name, and then the new name,

110
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:46,850
which I'm calling it base. And
now let's verify remote minus V,

111
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:50,419
and it's changed to base.

112
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,830
So now if we do, then you can do
git push, not origin, but base.

113
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,330
Now, instead of
pushing your existing repo,

114
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:06,440
you can also start directly with
the GitHub, create a repo, clone it,

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,200
and then start to working on it.

116
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,879
So let's see how that looks.

117
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,080
Let's say I did not start with my
repository on my local machine,

118
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,370
but instead I can just go to repo.new.

119
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,690
Okay, I have typo in my URL, repo.new.

120
00:09:29,529 --> 00:09:32,360
Let's create another repo.

121
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,019
Git repo demo.

122
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,090
Demo for Git repository.

123
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,370
Let's create this repo.

124
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:55,190
And now instead of using
Pushing an existing repository.

125
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:58,700
Now I don't have this repo
at all on my local machine.

126
00:09:59,529 --> 00:10:03,169
So what I can do is I will just copy it,

127
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,480
copy the URL and clone the
repository into my computer.

128
00:10:08,659 --> 00:10:17,399
So let's go back to our folder and
here do git clone and write the URL.

129
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,320
Now let's move to this repo with CD.

130
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:32,980
So right now, it's an empty
repository. I'm trying to open it in my VS Code.

131
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:35,559
There's nothing in it,
but it's a Git repository.

132
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:42,059
So now you can just start to
add files like I did, file1.txt.

133
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,830
This is my Git repo.

134
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:54,850
Now, if you do git status, then
it also shows you that, okay,

135
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,259
you have this file which you have created.

136
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,210
So we can do the same
thing as we did before.

137
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:07,350
We added a file, git add all,
and then we will commit it.

138
00:11:10,289 --> 00:11:14,769
First repo, and then git push.

139
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,970
Let's verify.

140
00:11:23,059 --> 00:11:29,720
So we have the file1.txt in our remote
repo. So here, the commit that we did,

141
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,350
it is the repo, the changes
are pushed to the remote server.

142
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,490
Let's recap again.

143
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,129
So we saw there were two ways.

144
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:44,899
So first thing what we did was that
we pushed an existing repo to GitHub.

145
00:11:45,419 --> 00:11:49,899
So we started with our local
computer. We created a project.

146
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,360
And then we pushed the
files to the remote server.

147
00:11:55,379 --> 00:12:00,039
So this is how I usually start
whenever I want to create a new project.

148
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,000
I often start with the local
machine. I just create it on my computer,

149
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,309
initialize it as a Git repository,
and then push it to the remote server.

150
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:15,289
Another way which we saw was that
you start with the GitHub. You start,

151
00:12:15,289 --> 00:12:22,480
create a Git repo with repo.new, And
then you copy that URL from the GitHub,

152
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,769
clone the repo in your local
machine, and push your changes.

153
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:29,600
So it depends on you, however you prefer.

154
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:34,149
You can start from the local
machine and then push it to GitHub,

155
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:38,610
or you can clone from the
GitHub and start to work on it.
