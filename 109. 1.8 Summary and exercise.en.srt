1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,599
Just to recap what we
learned in this section,

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,539
the first thing we talked
about was version control.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,740
So we talked about
what is version control.

4
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,179
Git is an open source
version control system,

5
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,589
which gives us ability
to track changes within

6
00:00:21,589 --> 00:00:24,570
the same file without
creating multiple files.

7
00:00:25,129 --> 00:00:27,859
Also, it allows us to
collaborate with other people.

8
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:30,940
Then we also talked about what is GitHub.

9
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,920
In GitHub, we saw that Git and
GitHub both are two separate things.

10
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,649
Git is a version control software,

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:41,700
whereas GitHub is a hosting
platform where you can host your

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,369
Git repositories so that
you can work with your peers.

13
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:50,439
Then we talked about Git
terminologies. We talked about three terminologies.

14
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,899
The first one we talked
about was Git repository.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:59,950
We saw that repository is nothing but
a project with .git folder inside it.

16
00:01:00,509 --> 00:01:03,149
And that .git folder does
all the tracking for you.

17
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,629
Next we talked about was remote,

18
00:01:06,629 --> 00:01:12,140
and we saw that the project on our
local machine has to be hosted on

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,549
the remote server if we want to
work together with our teammates.

20
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:20,810
So that is a remote
server, which we call remote.

21
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:23,640
Third we talked about is origin.

22
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:31,370
And we saw that whenever we host our
project on GitHub, it provides us with a URL,

23
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:34,640
which is a remote URL of the repository.

24
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:39,349
Because the URL is long, we
provide it an alias, origin,

25
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,359
because that is handy to use.

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,390
Third we talked about was
the setup and configurations.

27
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,849
We learned how to install
Git on our local machine.

28
00:01:49,329 --> 00:01:52,650
We saw the setups for
Mac, Linux, and Windows.

29
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,049
After the setup, we saw
how we can configure Git.

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:02,040
There are mainly two things that we
need to add to the Git config file.

31
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,379
One is your name, another
one is your email address.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,490
Make sure the email address that
you are adding in the configuration

33
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,270
is same as the one you have
registered with on your GitHub profile.

34
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:17,889
Next, we talked about
creating and cloning repositories.

35
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:23,099
We saw how we can create our
repository starting on our local machine.

36
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,080
We also saw that how we
can download any public

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,060
repository with the git clone command.

38
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:34,189
And finally, we talked
about how to push our existing

39
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:38,069
repository on our local
machine to the GitHub server.

40
00:02:39,229 --> 00:02:44,810
We saw two ways that we can,
whenever we are starting with the project,

41
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:49,590
we can either start with our local
computer, start a project there,

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,379
and then push it to GitHub server.

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,360
Alternatively, you can
also start with the GitHub.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,199
You can create a repo there. You
can use repo.new as a shortcut.

45
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,250
And create your repository. Once
you have the link to your repository,

46
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,539
you can clone it to your
computer and start to make changes.

47
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:17,539
Time to move to the exercise now. So part
one of this exercise is create a project.

48
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,199
You can name your project
anything, whatever you like.

49
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,000
And create a file, learninggit.txt in it.

50
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:29,090
You can add any content in that text file.

51
00:03:29,469 --> 00:03:32,449
Commit the file and push
the project on the GitHub.

52
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:38,770
Part two of this exercise is that
try to change the name of the origin.

53
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,310
You can change it to base.

54
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:46,020
Change the file and then push
it to your remote server again.

55
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,340
Change the remote name
back to origin and verify

56
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:53,500
if the remote is changed
back to original or not.

57
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,360
You can do it with git
remote hyphen b command.

58
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:00,360
You can check if the
origin is set correctly.
