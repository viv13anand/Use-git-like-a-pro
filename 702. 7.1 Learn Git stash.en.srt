1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,939
Stash is a place where you can
temporarily save the changes you made to your working

2
00:00:11,939 --> 00:00:16,820
directory so that you can work on
something else and come back to it later.

3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,320
It's very useful when you have to
quickly switch branches to work on something

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,210
else while you were already in
the middle of changing a file.

5
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,030
Let's take an example.

6
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:33,490
Let's say you were working on a
feature and you have some uncommitted files.

7
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:37,229
Now, maybe there was a bug in master,

8
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:41,000
so you have to quickly go back
to the master to fix the bug.

9
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,270
In order to do that, you will run
command-git checkout master, but in this case,

10
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:49,450
there can be two possible scenarios.

11
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:53,189
Since you have some uncommitted files,

12
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:58,759
if those uncommitted files are new
set of files which are not on master,

13
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:02,329
you would move to the
master because there are

14
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,909
no conflicts along with
the set of new files.

15
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:12,939
Another case is that you have modified
the set of files which are already on master.

16
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:18,560
In this case, when you try to move
to master using git checkout command,

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,769
git will give you an error that your
local changes would be overwritten by checkout.

18
00:01:24,469 --> 00:01:28,400
Please commit your changes or
stash them before switching branches.

19
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,930
So here you have one option that you
can commit your changes Or you can also

20
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:40,799
do is that you can put your
changes in a special place called stash.

21
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:46,980
So you can keep your changes on the
stash and move to the master branch,

22
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,890
fix the bug which is in
the master branch, come back

23
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,730
to the feature branch,
and apply the changes.

24
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,189
So Git stash is really handy if you
are in the middle of making changes in

25
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:04,560
a feature branch and you have to
quickly switch to a different branch.

26
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,150
How do we use git stash?

27
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,409
So we can use command git stash push.

28
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:16,280
This will push the entry into the
stash with all the uncommitted files.

29
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,819
Then you can use git stash pop,

30
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:22,099
which will take out the changes
from the stash and apply them.

31
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,539
We also have git stash apply.

32
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:30,189
It also applies thick stash changes,
but preserve the entry in the stash.

33
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:35,090
It is useful if you want to apply
the same changes to multiple branches.

34
00:02:36,189 --> 00:02:41,280
Please note that git stash command does
not push the untracked files to stash.

35
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:47,009
In order to push all the files to
stash, including untracked ones,

36
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:52,949
use command git stash push minus u
minus k. Let's go back to our repo.

37
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:02,740
I will create a new feature
branch, git checkout-p feeds-demo.

38
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,250
Let's change the file one again.

39
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:15,030
Also, let's create a new file,
like file4.txt, new file for stash.

40
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:25,729
Now my feature branch already
has some uncommitted changes.

41
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:31,280
Now if I move to my master
branch, git checkout main,

42
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,340
I would be able to
successfully move to the main

43
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,590
branch and my changes also move with me.

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:43,719
So if I do get status, I
have all the changes which

45
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:47,219
I made on the feature
branch on the main branch.

46
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:55,009
Otherwise, what I could do was
simply go back to my feature branch.

47
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:02,710
I can choose to push the
changes into the stash.

48
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,060
One thing to note here is that git
stash, because I ran git stash push,

49
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,620
And let's check the git status.

50
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,670
So we have only pushed
the file one, but file four

51
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:20,889
was a newly created
file, so it was not pushed.

52
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:26,110
Let's pop the changes, and
let's try to push it again.

53
00:04:27,189 --> 00:04:32,410
So if you want to push both
tracked and untracked files,

54
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:37,160
we want to push both file 4 and file 1.

55
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,120
So we can do it using git stash push .

56
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,540
This will also push your
untracked files in the stash.

57
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,290
So now I can go back to the main branch.

58
00:04:53,189 --> 00:04:56,920
If I want to make any
changes to the main branch,

59
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,100
like we talked about a
bug. So let's do a bug fix.

60
00:05:08,569 --> 00:05:09,329
Make the change.

61
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,439
Bug fix, git commit.

62
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:26,779
And now I can go back to my feature
branch where I was working before.

63
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:34,189
Git checkout features dash demo.

64
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,579
And I can apply back the changes.

65
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:48,449
So now I have the changes which I
made to my Stash demo feature branch.

66
00:05:49,120 --> 00:06:03,970
So this is how you can use Stash Let's
see what happens if I commit these changes,

67
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:10,920
git add all, git commit, commit one.

68
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,240
I have committed my
changes on the feature branch.

69
00:06:19,019 --> 00:06:20,800
Now I will make more changes.

70
00:06:22,379 --> 00:06:24,670
Let's change the file one.

71
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:39,319
So now, when I try to move to main
branch, this will give me an error.

72
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,370
Your local changes to the following
files would be overwritten by checkout,

73
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:50,649
so please commit or stash
them before you switch branches.

74
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:56,629
And this is because file one has
a different text in this branch,

75
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:00,519
whereas file one has a
different text in main branch.

76
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,269
So we are not able to directly switch.

77
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,569
So of course we can do is git stash.

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:12,879
Push this time because it's
already an existing file.

79
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:15,339
We don't need to use minus you flag.

80
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
We can simply do get stash push.

81
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,829
We can go back to our main branch.

82
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:28,889
Do the fix or whatever we want to work on,

83
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:33,829
and then we can go back to
our feature branch and pop the

84
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:37,629
changes whenever we are done
working on the main branch.

85
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,360
So let's create another Bug fix 2.

86
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,680
Git add all. Git commit.

87
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,199
Bug to fix.

88
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:00,620
And now we can go back
to our feature branch.

89
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,860
Git checkout.

90
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:09,000
Stash demo.

91
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,279
Let's say I want to apply these
stashed changes to the main branch.

92
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:20,230
So let's stash these changes again.

93
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,899
And let's say I want to apply
these changes to another branch.

94
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
So we can go to the main branch,

95
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,430
and let's say I want to
apply it on the main branch.

96
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,870
So I will do git stash pop,

97
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:38,379
but this time there
will be conflicts Because

98
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:42,950
the stashed entry had a different
change, which was stash demo 2.

99
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,590
And the main branch had a different
text, which is bug fix bug fix 2.

100
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:50,799
So you can choose which
ones you want to apply.

101
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,360
Let's say we want to accept both changes.

102
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:54,519
And now you have.

103
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:57,909
Resolve the changes
because of the git stash pop.
