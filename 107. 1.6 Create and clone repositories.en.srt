1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,880
So let's create our first repository.

2
00:00:09,619 --> 00:00:12,119
We already talked about
what a repository is.

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,679
It's just a project with
.git folder inside it.

4
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:22,070
This .git folder does all the tracking
of changes in your files in your project.

5
00:00:22,839 --> 00:00:26,609
In order to start with a
repository, you need to initialize git.

6
00:00:27,089 --> 00:00:29,269
So you need to do git init in the project.

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,560
It will create a .git
folder inside the project,

8
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,219
and git will start to
track your project files.

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,320
Sometimes you don't want Git
to track some of your files,

10
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,130
so you can add a file which is .gitignore,

11
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,119
and you can add all the files which
you don't want to track in that file.

12
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,520
Let's see how this looks in practice.

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:01:01,020
So let's start with the project. Let's
create a project. Let's call it Git course.

14
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:06,629
Let's move into the course directory.

15
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:13,689
And I will open it in my Visual
Studio Code using the command code dot.

16
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,689
If you're not able to do it like this,

17
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:21,159
then you need to go to the
Visual Studio Code and type

18
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,640
your install code command
and path shell command.

19
00:01:25,209 --> 00:01:31,099
Once you install it, you would be able to
open any project with the code command.

20
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:40,060
Now let's here create a file.
Let's say I create a file1.txt,

21
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:45,170
and this is my first Git repository.

22
00:01:47,989 --> 00:01:53,140
So right now, it's just a project with
one file. It's not a Git repository.

23
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:58,689
In order to make it a Git
repository, we need to do git init.

24
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:09,139
And as I do git init, let me do ls-a,
you will see the git folder is created.

25
00:02:09,159 --> 00:02:14,659
I did ls-a because this is a hidden
folder, so it creates a .git folder,

26
00:02:14,659 --> 00:02:16,870
which will do all your tracking,

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,539
and you can see that the
git is already initialized.

28
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,810
To verify it again, you
can run the status command.

29
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:26,810
So you can do git status.

30
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:32,229
And here, git tells you
that you are on branch main.

31
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:35,400
We'll talk about
branches later in the course,

32
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,590
but it says that you have
created one new file, file1.txt.

33
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:44,020
And there are no commits. We'll also be
talking about commits later in the course.

34
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:49,169
But basically, your project is
initialized as a Git repository. Now,

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:52,800
whatever changes you do in
this project is tracked by Git.

36
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:56,629
Now, sometimes you don't
want some files to be tracked.

37
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,069
So we talked about that
you can use gitignore file.

38
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:08,259
Such files can be your test files, or in
a lot of projects, it is node modules,

39
00:03:08,259 --> 00:03:10,240
that you have node modules.

40
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:18,409
And Let's create
something here, datefn.js.

41
00:03:19,189 --> 00:03:25,139
Let's say you have some node modules, and
I don't want to track The node modules.

42
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:32,330
So right now, if I do git status, then
git does tell me that you have two files,

43
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,689
like file one and also
this folder, node modules.

44
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,409
But what I want to tell Git
is ignore the node modules.

45
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:43,349
All the changes in node
modules, Git should not care about.

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,099
So I will create
gitignore. Yeah, just .gitignore.

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,419
And here, write node modules.

48
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:03,840
Now when I run my status
command, now we only have two files.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,349
One is the gitignore file, which
I just created, and file1.txt,

50
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:11,120
but we don't have any node modules.

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:17,939
So this is how you can ignore some
files by adding them to gitignore.

52
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:25,329
There's often another folder which we
usually ignore is the coverage folder.

53
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:27,829
This includes your test coverage.

54
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,540
So you can also exclude it from the
git by just adding it to your gitignore.

55
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:39,339
There are a bunch of ways in
which you can generate your gitignore

56
00:04:39,339 --> 00:04:42,439
file automatically because
there are some available templates.

57
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,769
I'm going to show you
one of the such template.

58
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:47,170
So just...

59
00:04:48,569 --> 00:04:52,600
You can go to toptal.com
slash developer slash gitignore,

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,670
and here you can select the programming
language. Let's say I have selected React,

61
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:01,329
and now when I click on create,

62
00:05:01,329 --> 00:05:04,750
it generates like a
template for the gitignore file.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,069
So it means that if you are
working on a React project,

64
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,040
Those are the files which you
would add in the gitignore.

65
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:15,000
You can always change it
according to your requirements.

66
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,649
So this is also one
way you can generate it.

67
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:22,610
You can also do the
same for like the Python.

68
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,660
So let's say I have selected
Python as the programming language.

69
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,399
Now I say create, and it creates this.

70
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,060
There are a lot of files like
coverage folder, cache folder.

71
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,829
So it has created a template for us, and
then we can modify according to our needs.

72
00:05:41,189 --> 00:05:43,529
Now we know how to create our repository.

73
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:47,199
Now let's also see how to
clone a public repository.

74
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:52,199
In order to clone a public
repository, you need to use git clone command.

75
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,389
Let's try to clone a public
repo, which is FlowByte React.

76
00:05:56,949 --> 00:05:58,790
So I will go to their website.

77
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,779
So this is their website, and I want to
download this repo to my local computer.

78
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:11,560
So what I can do is just click on the
code and use HTTPS and copy the link here.

79
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,110
Now here you can use git clone
command and type the copied URL.

80
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:24,649
Once we hit enter, it
will Basically, download it,

81
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:28,750
and now you can see if we already have it.

82
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:35,939
So it's FlowByte React is already
created. I will just move to FlowByte React.

83
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:42,019
And you can open it again
in your Visual Studio Code,

84
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:46,759
and it will show you all the
code that is there in the repo.

85
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:52,990
So this is how you download any public
repo by using just git clone command.

86
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:56,170
Git clone and the URL of the repository.
