1
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:08,720
So let's install Git on your computer.

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,830
The installation process is slightly
different depending on your operating system.

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:18,870
For the Mac and Linux users,
Git comes already pre-installed.

4
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,699
In order to verify this, you
can simply type in your terminal,

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:24,949
Git hyphen hyphen version,

6
00:00:24,949 --> 00:00:29,320
and it will tell you which version
of Git is installed on your computer.

7
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:34,240
Like for example, if I go to my
terminal and I do Git hyphen hyphen version,

8
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:40,929
It tells me that I have
2.32.1 Git installed.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,409
But if you want to
update or reinstall Git,

10
00:00:45,409 --> 00:00:51,420
you can do so by simply selecting macOS
or Linux links on the official Git website.

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,799
I have already provided a link here,

12
00:00:53,799 --> 00:00:57,560
so just go to the website and
click on macOS and download it.

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,439
For the Windows users, you can also
download Git from the same official website,

14
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,980
and just instead of Mac, select Windows.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,040
The installation is quite straightforward.

16
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:14,329
Just that on the screen which
asks you to select the text editor,

17
00:01:14,329 --> 00:01:19,890
there will be Vim selected by default.
You can change it to any other text editor,

18
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:24,170
like here in two of the cores, I
would be using Visual Studio Code.

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,670
So you can change it to
VS Code if you want to,

20
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,870
or any other editor
which you prefer to use.

21
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,069
So we have Git installed. Next step
is getting your text editor installed.

22
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:39,819
Since we would be creating and
editing files throughout this course,

23
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:42,959
I would suggest you to
download Visual Studio Code.

24
00:01:43,739 --> 00:01:46,049
I have provided the link
for Visual Studio Code,

25
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:48,359
so feel free to download
it into your computer.

26
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:53,750
You can also follow along with any
other text editor, whichever you prefer,

27
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,180
Sublime, Atom, or IntelliJ,

28
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:59,099
but I would be using Visual
Studio Code throughout the course.

29
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:04,019
After installing Git and after
having our text editor set up,

30
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:07,290
the next step is to have a GitHub account.

31
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:12,870
Note that whenever you
create the GitHub account,

32
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,680
copy the username and your email
address because you would be using

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,680
this username and email address
when you configure Git locally.

34
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:25,629
So make sure you have
noted the username and email

35
00:02:25,629 --> 00:02:28,280
address which you have
registered with the GitHub.

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,000
Now to create an
account, go to www.github.com.

37
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,870
So just go to github.com.

38
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,879
And we'll click on Sign Up.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,060
Enter your email.

40
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,960
Please note down the email
which you used to register with

41
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,680
it because we would need it
for the Git configuration.

42
00:02:54,419 --> 00:02:55,439
Create a password.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,650
Click on Continue.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,770
Enter the username. Also make sure you
have noted down the username as well.

45
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:17,439
You can simply click on Continue,
verify your account, and let's submit.

46
00:03:20,949 --> 00:03:25,990
So we are almost done. You will receive
a code on your email. Just fill it up,

47
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:28,909
and that's everything about
the registration with GitHub.
