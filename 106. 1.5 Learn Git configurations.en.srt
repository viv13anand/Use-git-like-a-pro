1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,410
Now that we have installed Git,
we have installed our text editor,

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,150
and we also have set
up our GitHub account,

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,820
next thing we need to do is
to do some Git configurations.

4
00:00:17,949 --> 00:00:22,500
First of all, check that if you already
have Git installed with this command,

5
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,800
git hyphen hyphen version.

6
00:00:24,379 --> 00:00:27,820
So for the configurations, you
just need to add your name and email.

7
00:00:28,539 --> 00:00:32,320
You can set it up using
git global config. For that,

8
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,490
you just need to run the
command git config hyphen

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,659
hyphen global user dot
name and type in your name.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:44,270
Then git config hyphen hyphen global
user dot email and type in the email.

11
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:48,859
Now make sure the email address
which you type in here should be the

12
00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:52,020
same email address which you
signed up into your GitHub account.

13
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:57,399
Another way to set up the configuration
is directly editing the git config file.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,100
You can open the git config file
and add the name and email there.

15
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,180
Let's see how that looks
when we actually do it.

16
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:10,390
So let's first check what is
the config I already have.

17
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,030
You can do it using git
config hyphen hyphen list.

18
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:20,670
So I already have things set up. I
already have user dot email and user dot name.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:29,810
But I can still override it with git
config hyphen hyphen global and user dot name.

20
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:32,689
And I can just simply do it.

21
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:39,340
Ashima, and now if I just
check if this is saved or not,

22
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,299
now you can see the user.name is Ashima.

23
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:56,879
Let me just set it back again. hyphen
hyphen global user.name And similarly,

24
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:05,549
for the email, you can
type in your email address.

25
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,699
Now, why we need to set the
name and email is because

26
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:24,699
Git needs to know your name and email when

27
00:02:24,699 --> 00:02:28,020
you make any commit so
that it knows who committed

28
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,680
it and what was the email address used.

29
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,639
So without it, you won't be
able to make any commits in Git.

30
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,900
The another way which I showed you
was simply editing the git config file.

31
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:48,389
So you can open it vi using vim.gitconfig.

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,270
And here you can see that I
edited my email and there is a

33
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:04,560
name so you can just Press I and
start to type anything, and just save it.

34
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:10,430
Alternatively, if you are not
very comfortable with Vim commands,

35
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:14,250
I prefer to do it open
with Visual Studio Code.

36
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:23,439
So I just do code.gitconfig, and
this will open it in Coding editor.

37
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:28,629
So here, I have this
opened inside my coding editor,

38
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,889
and I can just change
it here, easily type it.

39
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,810
Let me also change back my name again.

40
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,530
So you can choose any of the
way which is comfortable for you.

41
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,949
You can do it via command line,

42
00:03:44,949 --> 00:03:50,250
or you can also just open the git config
file and edit it directly into the file.

43
00:03:51,449 --> 00:03:54,909
Sometimes you don't know
where your file is. So

44
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:57,909
usually with the Mac,
it is going to be here.

45
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,590
But in case you don't know where it is,

46
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,289
I think there is a command
which you can check git config.

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,580
Hyphen, hyphen, git config hyphen
hyphen list hyphen hyphen show origin.

48
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:21,939
And that will tell you where it
exists. Like, for example, in my case,

49
00:04:21,939 --> 00:04:24,810
it existed inside
users, ashimahuja.gitconfig,

50
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,980
and that's why I was opening
it through tilt.gitconfig.

51
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,500
So if you want to know where your file
is, you can know the path from this command.
