1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:10,220
While working with Git, you will
come across many Git terminologies.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,380
The first one we will
talk about is repository.

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,019
So basically, when we
set up Git in our project,

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:21,050
it creates a .git
folder inside the project.

5
00:00:22,149 --> 00:00:27,629
The .git folder is what will do all the
versioning and file tracking for you.

6
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:33,250
A project with .git folder
inside it is referred as repository.

7
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:41,570
To recap, the repository is nothing but
your project with .git folder inside it.

8
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:46,670
The .git folder does all the file
tracking, and if this folder is deleted,

9
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:49,280
all the versioning and
tracking will be lost.

10
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:53,770
Next terminology we
will talk about is remote.

11
00:00:54,689 --> 00:00:58,600
So we already talked about that
you have a project on your local,

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,609
but you want to host it
on the internet because

13
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:04,620
you want to collaborate with
your peers, with your coworkers.

14
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,939
So in that case, when you host
your project to the internet,

15
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:12,230
it refers to as remote server.

16
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,659
This server can be of GitHub, it can
be of GitLab, or it can be Bitbucket.

17
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,230
Third terminology which we
are going to discuss is origin.

18
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:26,519
You will hear this
terminology a lot, a lot, many times.

19
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:31,140
So basically, now you have your
project hosted on a remote server.

20
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:37,140
In order to read and write into
that project, you need a URL,

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,569
which is going to be your remote
repository URL. This URL is really long,

22
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:47,939
and if you have to read and write
into it, we have to write the whole URL.

23
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,280
So what Git provides us is with
an alias, which is called origin.

24
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,670
Origin is just an alias, which we
will use for the remote repo URL.

25
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:04,590
So that whenever you want to
read or write into the repository,

26
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:07,349
you don't have to write the entire URL,

27
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,419
but you can simply use origin
