1
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:08,019
What is an interactive rebase?

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:11,900
Interactive rebase allows you
to rewrite the commit history.

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,690
With interactive rebase, you can do a
bunch of things like changing commit messages.

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,530
You can also combine multiple
commits, which is squashing.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,989
Then you can also split
and edit existing commits.

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:28,839
You can reorder commits
or even delete commits.

7
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,869
You can also change a commit message
using amend command, but with amend,

8
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:37,390
you can only amend the last commit.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,159
Interactive rebase allows you to
reword any commit in your Git history.

10
00:00:44,149 --> 00:00:47,450
You can use the reword
keyword to change the message.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:50,939
This is how it looks on your screen,

12
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,170
that you can use reword and
change the commit message.

13
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,119
You can combine multiple
commits using squash keyword.

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,549
In order to open the
screen with interactive rebase,

15
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,219
run command git rebase
minus i head tilde n.

16
00:01:06,219 --> 00:01:12,340
N here also refers to how many
commits you want to go back from head.

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,069
You can also delete
commits with Interactive Rebase.

18
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,359
In order to delete a
commit, use drop keyword.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,340
Let's see how
everything looks in practice.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,870
We would be amending
commits, squashing commits,

21
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:31,420
and deleting commits
using Interactive Rebase.

22
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:34,450
Let's go back to our repository.

23
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:38,269
Let me here just make three commits.

24
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:56,030
Interactive rebase commit one,
git add all, git commit minus m,

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,549
interactive rebase commit one.

26
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,129
Let's make two more commits.

27
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,370
We need to add it and then make a commit.

28
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:17,580
And the third commit with
git add all and git commit.

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:21,289
Let's verify our commits.

30
00:02:22,289 --> 00:02:25,210
So now we have commit one,
commit two, and commit three.

31
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,819
Now I want to change the
message of second last commit.

32
00:02:30,909 --> 00:02:35,129
Remember that if you want to change
the commit message of last commit,

33
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,409
you can use amend command as well.

34
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,009
But since we want to change the
message of second last commit,

35
00:02:42,009 --> 00:02:43,659
we can use interactive rebase.

36
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:50,719
In order to change the message of
second last commit, move one commit before,

37
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:53,530
which is this commit, copy the hash,

38
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,930
And now open interactive rebase
screen with git rebase, minus i,

39
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,789
minus i is for interactive,
and paste the copied hash.

40
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,240
Now you see your last two commits,

41
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,020
and we wanted to change
the message for commit to.

42
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,199
You can do it using reword keyboard.

43
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,080
So let's change pic to reword.

44
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,860
Click Escape, colon, WQ.

45
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,259
So now Interactive Rebase asks
you to change the commit message.

46
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:46,270
Enter your new commit message. Press I,
and Interactive Rebase reverted commit.

47
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,750
Let's save it, and let's
verify in the git log.

48
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:05,030
So see, we have changed the
message of second last commit,

49
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,830
and now it says
interactive rebase reworded commit.

50
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,460
In order to open the interactive
rebase screen, you can also use head.

51
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,379
Let's say now I want to change the
commit message of third last commit,

52
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:27,459
so I need to go Either I can do is
copy the hash of one commit before,

53
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:34,670
or what I can do is I can say
get rebase minus I head three.

54
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:38,910
This means go three commits before head.

55
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,480
So now you can see
your last three commits,

56
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:49,129
and we want to change the
commit message of the first commit.

57
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,800
So let's check reword, escape
wq, and let's change this as well.

58
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:12,050
Interactive rebase, escape wq.

59
00:05:13,209 --> 00:05:19,209
Now let's verify in Git log, and we have
changed the message of third last commit.

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,689
So this is how you can
use interactive rebase

61
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:26,100
to change the messages of your commits.

62
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,009
Now let's see how we can use
interactive rebase to squash our commits.

63
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,470
We can play with the same commits.

64
00:05:37,089 --> 00:05:42,430
Now let's say I want to squash all
three commits, commit one, commit two,

65
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,100
and commit three into a single commit.

66
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,339
So first thing we need to do
is open the interactive rebase.

67
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:56,759
So we copy the commit, one commit
before, or we can also use head.

68
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:05,759
In order to open interactive rebase,
click on right, get rebase minus I, head,

69
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,899
because we want to squash
our last three commits.

70
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,560
So I'm saying go three commits before.

71
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:18,930
Now I can see all of
my last three commits.

72
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:25,250
And here, let's say I
want to squash my second

73
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:29,379
and third commit on
top of my first commit.

74
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,360
So this commit one should also have
commit two and commit three files.

75
00:06:37,339 --> 00:06:40,639
In order to squash, change the squash.

76
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,019
Change pick to squash
for third commit as well.

77
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:51,379
What this will do is that it
will combine the two commits

78
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:54,360
with the squash into
the one which is picked.

79
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,189
Press escape, colon, wq.

80
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:09,079
Now here, what you can also do here
is you can provide your own message,

81
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,970
or you can simply use the git message.

82
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,310
I'm going to use the same
default one provided by git.

83
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:22,649
And now here you can say git log,

84
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:28,329
and it says that you have interactive
rebase commit one, the second commit,

85
00:07:28,329 --> 00:07:31,829
which we reworded, and
third commit as well.

86
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:38,870
So now it has created the combination of
last three commits into the single commit.

87
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:43,930
Last thing we want to also
practice is dropping commit.

88
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,329
So let's make two more commits.

89
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,670
Drop commit one.

90
00:07:58,569 --> 00:07:59,879
Get add all.

91
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:06,959
Get commit minus m. Drop one.

92
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:17,500
Let's make two commits, git
add all, git commit drop two.

93
00:08:18,819 --> 00:08:23,709
Let's verify these commits in the git log
command. So we have drop one and drop two.

94
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:26,629
Let me now delete this commit.

95
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,419
In order to do that, go to one
commit before, or you can also use head,

96
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:42,919
but let's copy this hash, open
interactive rebase, get rebase, minus i, commit hash.

97
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:58,029
Now we want to drop the second
commit, so let's choose drop, colon wq,

98
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Let's go to Git log and verify.

99
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,750
So now you can see the
second last commit which

100
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,360
we made dropped to, it has been removed.

101
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:16,159
So this is how you can use interactive
rebase to change the message of your commit.

102
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,820
Then you can also do
squashing using interactive rebase.

103
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:24,799
And finally, you can also delete
commits using interactive rebase.
