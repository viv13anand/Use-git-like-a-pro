Welcome to Lesson 1, Getting Started.

2
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,720
First of all, this and some of
the following chapters are mainly

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,460
meant for those who are not
familiar or are very new to Git.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:20,010
So if you're already
familiar with the basics of Git,

5
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,850
you may want to skip
through some of the concepts.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,410
If not, this is a great place to start.

7
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:30,410
We start off this chapter by
learning about version control,

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,500
followed by understanding Git and
some important Git terminologies

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,270
that you're going to be
hearing a lot throughout the course.

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,759
Next, we do the Git setup,
create our first repository.

11
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,299
We then wrap up the lesson with a
quick summary, followed by an exercise.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,840
Well, that's the plan for
this lesson. Let's get started.
